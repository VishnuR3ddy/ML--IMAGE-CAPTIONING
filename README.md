# ML--IMAGE-CAPTIONING
📸 Flickr8k Dataset: Image Captioning Preparation

Welcome to the repository for preparing and processing the Flickr8k Dataset for machine learning tasks like image captioning. This project showcases efficient dataset management, feature extraction, and preprocessing techniques to build a strong foundation for AI-based image-to-text systems.

🔑 Key Features

📥 Dataset Handling
Downloads the Flickr8k dataset and captions efficiently using Python scripts.
Extracts and organizes files into structured directories for seamless access.
🛠 Data Preprocessing
Parses image captions to prepare structured training data.
Leverages pre-trained models like VGG16 for feature extraction.
🤖 Model Preparation
Implements a sequence-to-sequence model for generating image captions.
Handles text tokenization, padding, and categorical encoding.
📊 Visualization
Displays generated captions directly on images for result evaluation.
Debugging options ensure high-quality output.
📂 Dataset Information

Images: Flickr8k_Dataset.zip
Captions: Flickr8k_text.zip
This dataset consists of 8,000 images paired with textual annotations, making it an ideal resource for image captioning tasks.
